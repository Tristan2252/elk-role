# Role: ELK Server

  

The Elastic Stack — formerly known as the ELK Stack — is a collection of open-source software produced by Elastic which allows you to search, analyze, and visualize logs generated from any source in any format, a practice known as centralized logging.

* Elasticsearch: This is an open source, distributed, RESTful, JSON-based search engine. It is scalable, easy to use, and flexible

* Logstash : This is a server‑side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a “stash” like Elasticsearch.

* Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.
